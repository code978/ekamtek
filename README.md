## Documentation

If you need a minimalistic library to utilize GitHub's REST API and GraphQL 
API which you can extend with plugins as needed, 
then @octokit/core is a great starting point.
If you don't need the Plugin API then using @octokit/request or @octokit/graphql directly is a good alternative.
